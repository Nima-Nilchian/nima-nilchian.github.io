I'm Nima, a Bachelor student in Computer Engineering at the University of Kharazmi with deep passion for Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I'm mainly interested in developing highly skilled AI systems that can contribute to social good, and Information Retrieval, specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs.

I've been working as an NLP Engineer at Farzan Institute, with a particular focus on creating chatbots and agentic workflows in the Mental Health domain.

My Research experience at Farzan Clinical Research Institute has allowed me to work on some really cool projects, like evaluating LLM's in different Medical tasks, like Multiple-Choice Questions, Case-Diagnosis, and Ethics and Biases of LLM's in Medical decision makings. I'm currently working on an RCT project.

 I’ve also taken on leadership roles, like being the President of the Student Scientific Association at my university and running Pointer Magazine. These experiences have helped me build strong teamwork and communication skills. My goal is to keep exploring how AI can make life better and work on projects that have a positive impact on people’s lives.
