#### 1 - Caceli:

This project aimed to predict whether users would cancel their tickets using machine learning models. After preprocessing the data and performing feature engineering, two models were trained: a Decision Tree Classifier for basic predictions and an ensemble approach using AdaBoost and Random Forest to enhance accuracy. The models' performance was evaluated using F1 scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices, demonstrating the application of basic and ensemble machine learning models.

#### 2 - Gender Detection:

The project aimed to predict the gender of Twitter and Instagram users based on the data provided. Preprocessing involved text normalization, tokenization, and removing stopwords using tools like Hazm and NLTK. The cleaned text data was then vectorized using a CountVectorizer. For modeling, a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the processed data, with the dataset split into training and validation sets. The model's performance was evaluated using F1 scores and classification reports, highlighting its effectiveness in gender prediction.

#### 3 - Text Categorization:

This project focused on developing a machine learning model to predict the categorical topic of a document based on text features like titles, descriptions, and full content. Preprocessing steps included text normalization, tokenization, and handling class imbalance using RandomOverSampler. The modeling process involved building a pipeline with a CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer, and a Linear SVM classifier to classify the documents. The model's performance was evaluated using the weighted F1-score, emphasizing its ability to accurately classify documents into the correct categories.
